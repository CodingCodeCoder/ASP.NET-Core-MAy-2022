# ASP.NET-Core-MAy-2022
My assignments on my course on ASP.NET CORE
This readme is simple, I will describe this project briefly.

First of all, my task was to create a website that would list products
and present a modal when a Product is clicked using ASP.NET Core and FrontEnd skills.
-All my files are organized.
-**I need to add more comments**
-will add more description to this project as I develop more.


I've learned how to CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE using a mock Repository.
